OverScrollView
=============

**This project is deprecated. Please use the much more flexible [overscroll-decor](https://github.com/EverythingMe/overscroll-decor)**

A ScrollView with over scroll capabilities, a complete replacement for android's ScrollView.
This is a revised version of Android 2.2 ScrollView (as it was the last version without android built in OverScroll).
This OverScrollView also solves the issue emerged on Android 2.3.5+ distributions by Samsung, which disabled over scroll completely (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9261911/samsung-galaxy-s2-2-3-5-not-calling-overscrollby)


Usage
-------

Use exactly as you would use standard ScrollView.



	 <me.everything.android.widget.OverScrollView
	        android:id="@+id/OverScroller"
	        android:layout_width="match_parent"
	        android:layout_height="match_parent" >

	     <.../>
	 </me.everything.android.widget.OverScrollView>
